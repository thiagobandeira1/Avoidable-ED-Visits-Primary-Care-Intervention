## 📌 Project Summary

This project presents a data-driven strategy to reduce **avoidable Emergency Department (ED) visits** among **Medicare Advantage** patients at **Mendez Medical Center**, using:

- **The NYU Emergency Department Algorithm (NYU-EDA)**
- **Physician-reviewed ICD-10 diagnoses**
- **Time-of-day and hospital-level analysis**
- **Financial impact modeling**
