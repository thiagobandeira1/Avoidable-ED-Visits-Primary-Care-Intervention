# Avoidable ED Visits – Primary Care Intervention

> A real-world healthcare data science project reducing unnecessary ED costs through evidence-based primary care.

This project presents a data-driven strategy to reduce avoidable Emergency Department (ED) visits among Medicare Advantage patients at **Mendez Medical Center**, using:

- The **NYU Emergency Department Algorithm (NYU-EDA)**
- Physician-reviewed ICD-10 diagnoses
- Time-of-day and hospital-level analysis
- Financial impact modeling

The article outlines:
- 40.2% avoidable ED rate among 15,253 claims
- Peak visits during after-hours and weekends
- Facility-level variation (Chi-Square tested)
- Estimated savings: **$2M–$2.7M/year**
- Intervention strategies: *Mendez Guarantee*, discharge education, protocol standardization

  
## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Python** (data wrangling, statistical modeling, classification logic)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** (data manipulation and computation)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (data visualization)
- **Statsmodels** (statistical inference, proportion testing)
- **NYU-EDA Classification** (Emergency Department algorithm)
- **ICD-10 Physician Review** (manual validation of diagnostic codes)
- **Time-based and Facility-level ED visit analysis**
- **Cost savings estimation using HCUP & CMS data**



## 💡 Impact
This scalable model aligns with value-based care and can reduce unnecessary healthcare spending while improving continuity, access, and outcomes in primary care settings.
